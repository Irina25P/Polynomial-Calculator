# Overview
- This project is a Polynomial Calculator implemented in Java, designed to perform various mathematical operations on polynomials.
- It allows users to input polynomials and execute operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration.
- The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate user interaction.

# Features
- Input polynomials and perform operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivation, and integration.
- Display results in a user-friendly interface with options to re-use or copy results.
- Supports efficient polynomial representation using Java's data structures.

# Usage
- Input one or two polynomials.
- Select an operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Derive, or Integrate).
- The result is displayed below the input fields.
- You can copy the result for further use or input it directly into another field.

# Future Improvements
- Add a dark/light mode theme for the user interface.
- Improve input validation with better error highlighting.
- Introduce real-time parsing and computation for enhanced user experience.
